    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Many university students experience irregular sleep schedules due to study pressure, extended screen time, and unhealthy daily habits.  \n",
    "Lack of proper sleep can affect focus, productivity, and overall mental and physical well-being. This project aims to study the factors that influence students’ sleep quality by analyzing real data and discovering patterns that connect lifestyle behaviors with sleep outcomes. Understanding these patterns can help raise awareness among students and encourage healthier academic and personal routines.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Problem Definition\n",
    "Students often struggle to maintain a consistent and healthy sleep schedule because of academic workload, high stress levels, and technology usage late at night.These behaviors lead to poor sleep quality, fatigue, and reduced academic performance. The problem addressed in this project is the lack of understanding of how different lifestyle factors such as study hours, caffeine intake, and physical activity interact and influence sleep quality. By analyzing these relationships, the project seeks to highlight the main contributors to irregular sleep among university students.\n",

    "## 1.2 Project Scope\n",
    "* Data Understanding: Using a real-world dataset that contains students’ lifestyle and academic factors such as study hours, screen time, caffeine intake, and physical activity.  \n",
    "* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, verifying data consistency, and preparing the dataset for analysis.  \n",
    "* Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring patterns and relationships between different variables to understand how lifestyle habits impact sleep quality.  \n",
    "* Visualization and Insights: Creating charts and statistical summaries to present findings about students’ sleep behaviors.  \n",
    "* Sleep Quality Prediction: Building a simple predictive framework that estimates or classifies sleep quality based on lifestyle and academic factors.  \n",
    "* Future Work: Expanding the system to provide personalized recommendations for improving sleep habits.\n",

    "The Student Sleep Patterns dataset is designed to analyze and predict how academic and lifestyle factors affect students’ sleep quality and duration. It includes information such as study hours, screen time, caffeine intake, stress levels, and physical activity, allowing the exploration of correlations between daily habits and sleep quality. The dataset supports modeling and prediction to identify key factors that influence healthy and balanced sleep routines among university students.\n",
