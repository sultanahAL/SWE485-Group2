    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Many university students experience irregular sleep schedules due to study pressure, extended screen time, and unhealthy daily habits.  \n",
    "Lack of proper sleep can affect focus, productivity, and overall mental and physical well-being. This project aims to study the factors that influence students’ sleep quality by analyzing real data and discovering patterns that connect lifestyle behaviors with sleep outcomes. Understanding these patterns can help raise awareness among students and encourage healthier academic and personal routines.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Problem Definition\n",
    "Students often struggle to maintain a consistent and healthy sleep schedule because of academic workload, high stress levels, and technology usage late at night.These behaviors lead to poor sleep quality, fatigue, and reduced academic performance. The problem addressed in this project is the lack of understanding of how different lifestyle factors such as study hours, caffeine intake, and physical activity interact and influence sleep quality. By analyzing these relationships, the project seeks to highlight the main contributors to irregular sleep among university students.\n",

    "* Data Understanding: Using a real-world dataset that contains students’ lifestyle and academic factors such as study hours, screen time, caffeine intake, and physical activity.  \n",
    "* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, verifying data consistency, and preparing the dataset for analysis.  \n",
    "* Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring patterns and relationships between different variables to understand how lifestyle habits impact sleep quality.  \n",
    "* Visualization and Insights: Creating charts and statistical summaries to present findings about students’ sleep behaviors.  \n",
    "* Sleep Quality Prediction: Building a simple predictive framework that estimates or classifies sleep quality based on lifestyle and academic factors.  \n",

    "Preprocessing is an essential step that prepares the dataset for accurate and meaningful analysis. It ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and properly formatted before performing any statistical or predictive modeling. The preprocessing phase typically involves checking for missing values, transforming variables, normalizing data ranges, and removing unnecessary or redundant information.\n",
    "### 4.1 Variable Transformation\n",
    "Transforming categorical variables into numerical form is an important step that enables proper statistical analysis and model training. In this dataset, variables such as **Gender** and **University_Year** contain categorical values that need to be represented numerically for easier processing and interpretation.  \n",
    "To achieve this, they were encoded into numeric values as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender:** Female → 0, Male → 1, Other → 2  \n",
    "- **University_Year:** 1st Year → 1, 2nd Year → 2, 3rd Year → 3, 4th Year → 4  \n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation helps standardize the data, allowing models to recognize and analyze relationships between categories more effectively.  \n",

After review, we confirmed that **Student_ID** serves only as a unique identifier and does not contain analytical value related to lifestyle or academic factors. Therefore, it was removed from the dataset to prevent unnecessary complexity and ensure the analysis focuses on relevant attributes such as sleep duration, study hours, screen time, and caffeine intake. Removing this column improves the dataset’s clarity and supports more accurate modeling and interpretation.\n"
