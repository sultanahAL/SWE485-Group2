## Project Title
Student Sleep Pattern Analyzer



## Project Motivation
Many university students experience irregular sleep schedules due to academic pressure, heavy study load, screen time, and caffeine consumption. This irregularity often leads to fatigue, poor academic performance, and mental health issues. The project aims to analyze and predict students’ sleep duration and quality using real-world data, focusing on factors such as study hours, stress levels, caffeine intake, and screen usage. By understanding these relationships, the system seeks to raise awareness and support the development of healthier study–sleep habits.



### Why This Problem?
Sleep quality directly affects students’ academic performance, concentration, and overall well-being. However, many students underestimate how lifestyle factors such as screen time, caffeine intake, and study hours influence their sleep. By investigating these factors, this project highlights the importance of healthy sleep routines in university life.



### Why This Dataset?
This dataset was chosen because it contains structured, student-related information that reflects real behavioral patterns. It includes measurable attributes like sleep duration, study hours, caffeine intake, and physical activity, which make it ideal for analyzing how daily habits impact sleep quality.
