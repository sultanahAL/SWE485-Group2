    "In this section, two generative AI prompt templates are implemented to enhance the system’s ability to analyze and interpret student sleep patterns. Both templates interact with the LLaMA model through the Groq API.\n",
    "### 1.1 Template 1: Brief Recommendation\n",
    "This template generates a short, focused recommendation based on the student’s sleep habits. It identifies the main issue and provides one or two essential suggestions. The output is intentionally concise and easy to understand, making it suitable for quick feedback.\n",
    "### 1.2 Template 2: Detailed Recommendation\n",
    "This template offers a comprehensive evaluation of the student’s sleep behavior. It compares the user’s inputs to dataset averages, analyzes the impact of habits such as screen time, caffeine, and physical activity, and examines weekday/weekend schedule consistency. The generated recommendation includes an overview, detailed analysis, and a multi-step action plan tailored for meaningful improvement.\n",

      "\n",
      "To improve your sleep, I recommend two practical suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n",
      "2. Wind down before bedtime: Avoid screens (e.g., phones, laptops, or TVs) and caffeine for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light and stimulating effects can interfere with your sleep.\n",

      "**Sleep Recommendation for This Student**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Short Overview**\n",
      "This student's sleep pattern reveals some concerning habits. With a sleep duration of 5 hours per night, which is significantly lower than the average of 6.5 hours, and an inconsistent sleep schedule, especially on weekdays where they wake up early despite sleeping in late, it's no wonder they're struggling with their sleep. Their excessive screen time, caffeine intake, and limited physical activity further exacerbate these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis**\n",
      "- **Sleep duration**: The student's sleep duration is 1.5 hours shorter than the average, indicating insufficient rest and recovery. This can lead to decreased concentration, memory, and mood issues, as well as a weakened immune system.\n",
      "- **Study hours and screen time impact**: The student spends 4 hours studying and 7 hours on screens daily. While studying is essential, excessive screen time can interfere with sleep. Aim for a balance between study hours and screen-free time to allow for relaxation before bed.\n",
      "- **Caffeine and physical activity impact**: The student's caffeine intake is 0.5 cups higher than average, which can disrupt sleep patterns. Regular physical activity is beneficial, but the student's 140 minutes per week is lower than the average of 62 minutes, suggesting a need for increased physical activity to promote better sleep.\n",
      "- **Weekday vs weekend schedule consistency**: The student's inconsistent sleep schedule, switching from late sleep to early wake on weekdays and late sleep to late wake on weekends, can confuse their body's internal clock, leading to poor sleep quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action Plan**\n",
      "To improve sleep quality, this student should:\n",
      "1. **Gradually increase sleep duration**: Aim for 6.5-7 hours of sleep each night, adjusting bedtime and wake-up times accordingly.\n",
      "2. **Balance study hours and screen time**: Allocate dedicated screen-free time (at least 2 hours) before bed for relaxation and reading or meditation.\n",
      "3. **Reduce caffeine intake**: Limit caffeine to 2-2.5 cups daily, avoiding consumption at least 4-6 hours before bedtime.\n",
      "4. **Increase physical activity**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, or a combination of both.\n",
      "5. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule**: Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, to regulate the body's internal clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Encouragement Message**\n",
      "By implementing these changes, this student can improve their sleep quality, boost their energy levels, and achieve better academic performance.\n"

    " ## 2. Template Comparison & Analysis\n",
    " ### Template 1: Brief Recommendation – Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Template 1 is a short-prompt structure.\n",
    "It is designed to generate fast and focused sleep advice.\n",
    "It uses the full student profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Gender  \n",
    "- University_Year  \n",
    "- Sleep_Duration  \n",
    "- Study_Hours  \n",
    "- Screen_Time  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake  \n",
    "- Physical_Activity  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_Start  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_Start  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_End  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_End  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is instructed to return only:\n",
    "- the main problem  \n",
    "- and one or two key suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the student profile is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: 24  \n",
    "- Gender: 2 (Female, according to the dataset coding)  \n",
    "- University_Year: 4  \n",
    "- Sleep_Duration: 5.0 hours per night  \n",
    "- Study_Hours: 4.0 hours per day  \n",
    "- Screen_Time: 7.0 hours per day  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake: 3.0 cups per day  \n",
    "- Physical_Activity: 140.0 minutes per week  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_Start: Late  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_Start: Late  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_End: Early  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_End: Late  \n",
    "\n",
    "When Template 1 is applied to this profile, the model produces a short answer.\n",
    "The output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identifies the core issue as not getting enough sleep  \n",
    "  (Sleep_Duration = 5.0 hours, with a 4th-year workload).  \n",
    "- highlights the high Screen_Time (7.0 hours per day) before bedtime  \n",
    "  as a major negative habit.  \n",
    "- suggests 1–2 concrete actions,  \n",
    "  such as going to bed earlier on weekdays  \n",
    "  and reducing screen exposure in the evening  \n",
    "  to reach about 7–8 hours of sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation is brief and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of Template 1’s output is high in terms of clarity.\n",
    "The language is simple and friendly.\n",
    "It is easy for a university student to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message goes directly to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what the main problem is  \n",
    "- and what the student should change first.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no long introduction.\n",
    "There is no complex technical wording.\n",
    "This makes the feedback suitable for quick guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level of Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Template 1 is intentionally low-detail.  \n",
    "The prompt still provides many profile features and dataset statistics to the model.  \n",
    "However, the instructions restrict the response to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- one main issue  \n",
    "- one or two practical, high-impact suggestions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, not every attribute in the profile appears in the generated text.  \n",
    "For example, Physical_Activity and weekend wake-up time may not be mentioned explicitly.  \n",
    "Even with this limitation, the output remains focused and easy to consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being brief, the recommendation is still strongly tied to the data.\n",
    "The model uses the actual values in the profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sleep_Duration = 5.0  \n",
    "- Screen_Time = 7.0  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake = 3.0  \n",
    "- Late / Early sleep schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are reflected in the explanation and the advice.\n",
    "The feedback does not look generic.\n",
    "It clearly reacts to this specific student profile\n",
    "and provides realistic steps the student can start with immediately."
