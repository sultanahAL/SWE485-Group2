    "## 1. Implementation\n",
    "In this section, two generative AI prompt templates are implemented to enhance the system’s ability to analyze and interpret student sleep patterns. Both templates interact with the LLaMA model through the Groq API.\n",
    "### 1.1 Template 1: Brief Recommendation\n",
    "This template generates a short, focused recommendation based on the student’s sleep habits. It identifies the main issue and provides one or two essential suggestions. The output is intentionally concise and easy to understand, making it suitable for quick feedback.\n",
    "### 1.2 Template 2: Detailed Recommendation\n",
    "This template offers a comprehensive evaluation of the student’s sleep behavior. It compares the user’s inputs to dataset averages, analyzes the impact of habits such as screen time, caffeine, and physical activity, and examines weekday/weekend schedule consistency. The generated recommendation includes an overview, detailed analysis, and a multi-step action plan tailored for meaningful improvement.\n",

      "**Overview**\n",
      "This student is struggling with inadequate sleep, with a sleep duration of just 5 hours per night, which is significantly below the dataset average of 6.5 hours. This, combined with a late sleep schedule and inconsistent weekend routine, may be affecting their productivity, energy levels, and overall well-being. Our goal is to help this student establish a healthier sleep routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sleep duration**: The student is getting 2.5 hours less sleep than the dataset average. This can lead to fatigue, decreased concentration, and a weakened immune system.\n",
      "- **Study hours and screen time**: With 4 hours of study time and 7 hours of screen time per day, the student is likely experiencing a significant amount of stress and mental stimulation before bedtime, making it difficult to fall asleep and maintain a consistent sleep schedule.\n",
      "- **Caffeine intake**: The student is consuming 0.5 cups more caffeine than the dataset average, which can interfere with sleep quality and duration.\n",
      "- **Physical activity**: While the student engages in physical activity, the 140 minutes per week is still below the dataset average, which may not be enough to promote better sleep.\n",
      "- **Weekday and weekend schedule consistency**: The student has a late sleep schedule on weekdays and a late wake schedule on weekends, which can disrupt their body's natural circadian rhythms and lead to confusion about sleep-wake times.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action Plan**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gradually increase sleep duration**: Aim to add 30 minutes to sleep time each week until reaching the dataset average of 6.5 hours. This can be achieved by going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night.\n",
      "2. **Adjust study and screen time routine**: Reduce screen time to 2 hours before bedtime and create a relaxing pre-sleep routine, such as reading or meditation, to signal to the brain that it's time to sleep.\n",
      "3. **Limit caffeine intake**: Reduce caffeine consumption to 2 cups per day to minimize its impact on sleep quality.\n",
      "4. **Increase physical activity**: Aim for at least 120 minutes of physical activity per week, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, to promote better sleep and overall well-being.\n",
      "5. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule**: Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, to regulate the body's internal clock and improve sleep quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Encouragement**\n",
      "By implementing these changes, you'll be on your way to establishing a healthier sleep routine that will help you feel more energized, focused, and prepared to tackle the demands of university life.\n"

    " ## 2. Template Comparison & Analysis\n",
    " ### Template 1: Brief Recommendation – Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Template 1 is a short-prompt structure.\n",
    "It is designed to generate fast and focused sleep advice.\n",
    "It uses the full student profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Gender  \n",
    "- University_Year  \n",
    "- Sleep_Duration  \n",
    "- Study_Hours  \n",
    "- Screen_Time  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake  \n",
    "- Physical_Activity  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_Start  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_Start  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_End  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_End  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is instructed to return only:\n",
    "- the main problem  \n",
    "- and one or two key suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the student profile is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: 24  \n",
    "- Gender: 2 (Female, according to the dataset coding)  \n",
    "- University_Year: 4  \n",
    "- Sleep_Duration: 5.0 hours per night  \n",
    "- Study_Hours: 4.0 hours per day  \n",
    "- Screen_Time: 7.0 hours per day  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake: 3.0 cups per day  \n",
    "- Physical_Activity: 140.0 minutes per week  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_Start: Late  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_Start: Late  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_End: Early  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_End: Late  \n",
    "\n",
    "When Template 1 is applied to this profile, the model produces a short answer.\n",
    "The output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identifies the core issue as not getting enough sleep  \n",
    "  (Sleep_Duration = 5.0 hours, with a 4th-year workload).  \n",
    "- highlights the high Screen_Time (7.0 hours per day) before bedtime  \n",
    "  as a major negative habit.  \n",
    "- suggests 1–2 concrete actions,  \n",
    "  such as going to bed earlier on weekdays  \n",
    "  and reducing screen exposure in the evening  \n",
    "  to reach about 7–8 hours of sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation is brief and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of Template 1’s output is high in terms of clarity.\n",
    "The language is simple and friendly.\n",
    "It is easy for a university student to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message goes directly to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what the main problem is  \n",
    "- and what the student should change first.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no long introduction.\n",
    "There is no complex technical wording.\n",
    "This makes the feedback suitable for quick guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level of Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Template 1 is intentionally low-detail.  \n",
    "The prompt still provides many profile features and dataset statistics to the model.  \n",
    "However, the instructions restrict the response to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- one main issue  \n",
    "- one or two practical, high-impact suggestions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, not every attribute in the profile appears in the generated text.  \n",
    "For example, Physical_Activity and weekend wake-up time may not be mentioned explicitly.  \n",
    "Even with this limitation, the output remains focused and easy to consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being brief, the recommendation is still strongly tied to the data.\n",
    "The model uses the actual values in the profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sleep_Duration = 5.0  \n",
    "- Screen_Time = 7.0  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake = 3.0  \n",
    "- Late / Early sleep schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are reflected in the explanation and the advice.\n",
    "The feedback does not look generic.\n",
    "It clearly reacts to this specific student profile\n",
    "and provides realistic steps the student can start with immediately."
