    "## 1. Implementation\n",
    "In this section, two generative AI prompt templates are implemented to enhance the system’s ability to analyze and interpret student sleep patterns. Both templates interact with the LLaMA model through the Groq API.\n",
    "### 1.1 Template 1: Brief Recommendation\n",
    "This template generates a short, focused recommendation based on the student’s sleep habits. It identifies the main issue and provides one or two essential suggestions. The output is intentionally concise and easy to understand, making it suitable for quick feedback.\n",
    "### 1.2 Template 2: Detailed Recommendation\n",
    "This template offers a comprehensive evaluation of the student’s sleep behavior. It compares the user’s inputs to dataset averages, analyzes the impact of habits such as screen time, caffeine, and physical activity, and examines weekday/weekend schedule consistency. The generated recommendation includes an overview, detailed analysis, and a multi-step action plan tailored for meaningful improvement.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Gradually adjust your bedtime**: Move your bedtime earlier on weekdays (e.g., 30 minutes every few days) to get closer to the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep.\n",

      "**Sleep Recommendation for University Student**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overview:** \n",
      "This student is struggling with sleep quality due to inadequate sleep duration, irregular sleep schedules, and excessive screen time and caffeine intake. As a result, they may experience fatigue, decreased concentration, and a lower immune system. Our goal is to help them establish a balanced sleep routine to improve overall well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sleep duration vs dataset average:** The student is getting 5 hours of sleep per night, which is well below the average of 6.5 hours. This can lead to sleep deprivation and negatively impact physical and mental health.\n",
      "- **Study hours and screen time impact:** The student spends 4 hours studying and 7 hours on screens daily, which can lead to an overload of stimulating activities before bedtime, making it difficult to fall asleep. \n",
      "- **Caffeine and physical activity impact:** While the student consumes 3 cups of caffeine, this is slightly above the average, but their physical activity level is higher than the average at 140 minutes per week. However, physical activity should ideally be done in the morning or early afternoon to avoid interfering with sleep.\n",
      "- **Weekday vs weekend schedule consistency:** The student's sleep schedule is inconsistent between weekdays and weekends, which can disrupt the body's natural rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gradually increase sleep duration:** Aim to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night by establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine (e.g., reading, meditation, or deep breathing exercises).\n",
      "2. **Reduce screen time and study hours before bed:** Try to limit screen time to 2 hours before bedtime, and study for at least 2 hours before winding down with a relaxing activity. This will help signal to the brain that it's time to sleep.\n",
      "3. **Increase physical activity in the morning:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity in the morning, such as a brisk walk or a yoga session, to boost energy levels and set a positive tone for the day.\n",
      "4. **Establish a weekend sleep schedule:** Try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule on weekends by going to bed and waking up at a similar time to weekdays. This will help regulate the body's internal clock and make it easier to fall asleep on weekdays.\n",
      "5. **Limit caffeine intake:** Aim to reduce caffeine intake to 2 cups or less per day, and avoid consuming it in the afternoon or evening to avoid disrupting sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Encouragement:** By implementing these simple changes, you'll be well on your way to improving your sleep quality, increasing energy levels, and achieving academic success.\n"

    "\n",
    "Template 1 is a short-prompt structure.\n",
    "It is designed to generate fast and focused sleep advice.\n",
    "It uses the full student profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Gender  \n",
    "- University_Year  \n",
    "- Sleep_Duration  \n",
    "- Study_Hours  \n",
    "- Screen_Time  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake  \n",
    "- Physical_Activity  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_Start  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_Start  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_End  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_End  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is instructed to return only:\n",
    "- the main problem  \n",
    "- and one or two key suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the student profile is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: 24  \n",
    "- Gender: 2 (Female, according to the dataset coding)  \n",
    "- University_Year: 4  \n",
    "- Sleep_Duration: 5.0 hours per night  \n",
    "- Study_Hours: 4.0 hours per day  \n",
    "- Screen_Time: 7.0 hours per day  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake: 3.0 cups per day  \n",
    "- Physical_Activity: 140.0 minutes per week  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_Start: Late  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_Start: Late  \n",
    "- Weekday_Sleep_End: Early  \n",
    "- Weekend_Sleep_End: Late  \n",
    "\n",
    "When Template 1 is applied to this profile, the model produces a short answer.\n",
    "The output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identifies the core issue as not getting enough sleep  \n",
    "  (Sleep_Duration = 5.0 hours, with a 4th-year workload).  \n",
    "- highlights the high Screen_Time (7.0 hours per day) before bedtime  \n",
    "  as a major negative habit.  \n",
    "- suggests 1–2 concrete actions,  \n",
    "  such as going to bed earlier on weekdays  \n",
    "  and reducing screen exposure in the evening  \n",
    "  to reach about 7–8 hours of sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation is brief and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of Template 1’s output is high in terms of clarity.\n",
    "The language is simple and friendly.\n",
    "It is easy for a university student to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message goes directly to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what the main problem is  \n",
    "- and what the student should change first.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no long introduction.\n",
    "There is no complex technical wording.\n",
    "This makes the feedback suitable for quick guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level of Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Template 1 is intentionally low-detail.  \n",
    "The prompt still provides many profile features and dataset statistics to the model.  \n",
    "However, the instructions restrict the response to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- one main issue  \n",
    "- one or two practical, high-impact suggestions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, not every attribute in the profile appears in the generated text.  \n",
    "For example, Physical_Activity and weekend wake-up time may not be mentioned explicitly.  \n",
    "Even with this limitation, the output remains focused and easy to consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being brief, the recommendation is still strongly tied to the data.\n",
    "The model uses the actual values in the profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sleep_Duration = 5.0  \n",
    "- Screen_Time = 7.0  \n",
    "- Caffeine_Intake = 3.0  \n",
    "- Late / Early sleep schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are reflected in the explanation and the advice.\n",
    "The feedback does not look generic.\n",
    "It clearly reacts to this specific student profile\n",
    "and provides realistic steps the student can start with immediately."

    "\n",
    "#### Relevance\n",
    "-The advice is highly relevant as it directly addresses the student's critical issues.\n",
    "<br>-The template goes beyond just telling the student what to do it provides contextual reasoning (e.g., suggesting physical activity in the morning to avoid disrupting nighttime sleep) which helps the student understand why the behavioral changes are needed."

    "After comparing both templates, the final choice depends on the goal of the system and the user’s needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal is quick, simple feedback, Template 1 (Brief Recommendation) is suitable because it provides a fast summary of the main issue with 1–2 practical tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal is comprehensive, personalized guidance, Template 2 (Detailed Recommendation) is more effective because it analyzes all inputs, uses dataset averages, and produces a clear multi-step improvement plan.\n",

    "\n",
    "It provides deeper insight by connecting the student’s data to dataset statistics.\n",
