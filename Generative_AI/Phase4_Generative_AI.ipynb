    "In this section, two generative AI prompt templates are implemented to enhance the system’s ability to analyze and interpret student sleep patterns. Both templates interact with the LLaMA model through the Groq API.\n",
    "### 1.1 Template 1: Brief Recommendation\n",
    "This template generates a short, focused recommendation based on the student’s sleep habits. It identifies the main issue and provides one or two essential suggestions. The output is intentionally concise and easy to understand, making it suitable for quick feedback.\n",
    "### 1.2 Template 2: Detailed Recommendation\n",
    "This template offers a comprehensive evaluation of the student’s sleep behavior. It compares the user’s inputs to dataset averages, analyzes the impact of habits such as screen time, caffeine, and physical activity, and examines weekday/weekend schedule consistency. The generated recommendation includes an overview, detailed analysis, and a multi-step action plan tailored for meaningful improvement.\n",

      "Based on your profile, I'd say your main sleep problem is that you're not getting enough sleep, especially considering you're in your 4th year of university and need to perform well. To improve your sleep, try these two things:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Limit your screen time**: You have a lot of screen time, which can keep your brain active and make it hard to fall asleep. Try to reduce your screen time by at least 2 hours before bedtime.\n",
      "2. **Go to bed earlier on weekdays**: Your current sleep schedule is late → early, which can be tough on your body. Try to adjust your sleep schedule to go to bed a bit earlier each night, so you can get at least 7-8 hours of sleep.\n",

      "============================================================\n",
      "            TEMPLATE 2: DETAILED RECOMMENDATION             \n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "**Short Overview:**\n",
      "This student is struggling with poor sleep quality, which is impacting their daily life. Their sleep duration is significantly shorter than the average, and their inconsistent sleep schedule, excessive screen time, and caffeine intake are likely contributing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "- **Sleep duration vs dataset average:** The student's sleep duration of 5.0 hours is 1.5 hours shorter than the dataset average of 6.5 hours. This is a significant concern as it may lead to chronic sleep deprivation.\n",
      "- **Study hours and screen time impact:** The student's study hours of 4.0 hours are slightly below the dataset average, but their screen time of 7.0 hours is triple the dataset average. Excessive screen time can interfere with sleep quality, making it harder to fall asleep and reducing the quality of rest.\n",
      "- **Caffeine and physical activity impact:** The student's caffeine intake is 0.5 cups above the dataset average, which may disrupt sleep patterns. Additionally, their physical activity level is below the average, which is essential for maintaining a healthy sleep schedule. Aim for at least 60-90 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day.\n",
      "- **Weekday vs weekend schedule consistency:** The student's inconsistent sleep schedule, with a late sleep → early wake pattern on weekdays and a late sleep → late wake pattern on weekends, can confuse the body's internal clock and disrupt sleep quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action Plan:**\n",
      "1. **Gradually increase sleep duration:** Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night by establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. Start by increasing sleep duration by 30 minutes every 2-3 nights.\n",
      "2. **Reduce screen time:** Limit screen time to 2-3 hours before bedtime and replace it with relaxing activities like reading or meditation.\n",
      "3. **Adjust caffeine intake:** Limit caffeine intake to 2 cups or less per day, avoiding it in the afternoon and evening to minimize its impact on sleep.\n",
      "4. **Increase physical activity:** Aim for at least 90 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.\n",
      "5. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule:** Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, to help regulate the body's internal clock and improve sleep quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Encouragement:**\n",
      "By implementing these changes, you can improve your sleep quality, boost your energy levels, and enhance your overall well-being, setting yourself up for success in your university years.\n"
